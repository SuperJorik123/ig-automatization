shared/config.py — one place that loads .env and resolves shared paths.

Every entrypoint (root server.py, the platform scripts under modules/, the
Telegram bot) imports from here so PHONE_ADDRESS, the posts/ queue, and the
credentials resolve to the repo root no matter which subfolder the calling
file now lives in. Before the restructure each script did its own
`load_dotenv(<its own dir>/.env)`; once files moved into modules/<platform>/
that path pointed at a non-existent .env, so the lookup is centralised here.
